## Contributing

This app is built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) using [Expo](https://expo.io/). You'll need to install the [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) and the [latest version of Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

Be sure to use the expo versions of npm commands. For example use `expo install` rather than `npm install` (this one is very important since it could install the wrong versions otherwise).
